     <h1>Risør VGS</h1>

    <p>Risør VGS is a small school in Risør. <!--Max width of 500px because the text was too long on the website-->
        It does not have many students opposed to bigger towns. 
        In my first year there was only 300-400 students, but it got a lot less the next two years, because the neighbouring town built a new school. 
        It caused a lot of students to attend to the new school. 
        As of today, the school is in a bad situation, where it might get shut down due to lack of attendance. </p>
