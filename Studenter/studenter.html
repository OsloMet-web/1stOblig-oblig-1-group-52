    <p> Sandnes VGS is known as the old school of Sandnes. Sandnes VGS was the oldest school in the city of Sandnes, and this could be seen
        on the construction.The school was divided in two parts, the old and new corridors.You could clearly see the difference
        between the two.The majortiy of the pupils at Sandnes favorized the recently developed part. This was because of the air condition and the internet connection</p>

    <P>Risør VGS is a small school in Risør.
        It does not have many students opposed to bigger towns. 
        In my first year there was only 300-400 students, but it got a lot less the next two years, because the neighbouring town built a new school. 
        It caused a lot of students to attend to the new school. 
        As of today, the school is in a bad situation, where it might get shut down due to lack of attendance.

    <p>My school is one of the best schools in the nation for combing school and you're sport.
        You have a workout everyday before school.The school is located inside Skagerak Arena which is Odd's FC Stadium.

    <p>My VGS had a very open floor plan. So when we went to and from class, you could see across the whole cafeteria and all the other corridors.
        The school focused on media, service, hairdressing and art. </p>
